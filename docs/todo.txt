TODO:
- fix debug info icons on board, grave, anywhere else!
- game over results instead of trick results (when any player's hand.length === 0)
- graveyard to its own column and add stats next to each trick
- the trick/board trick thing is confusing.  
- domino.getValue/getName should depend on the LEAD value not necessarily the trump value
- clear log on new game
  - other stuff needs to be reset too - bid, grave on debug game, etc
- bug: domino name incorrect (ex: 2-3 follows a 2-2 and is called 3-2 in log)
- prompt to enter Player 1 name (during bid for now)
- flow: noCash argument to both lowest/highest method

DONE:
* AI follow with lowest trump when they cannot win trick otherwise highest!
* audit which things should happen before/after trick modal
* cleanup state
  * trump, bid amount to player's sub-heading
  * turn, leadValue, activePlayer to Board sub-heading
* end trick pops a modal with trick results and click button to start next trick
* setup navigation bar
* deliberation timeout to variable
* log should be set height and scroll
* add text activity log that shows every move
* add score total next to each player
* fix player button designn
* fix bid modal design
* EPIC: test bed needed (wow you pretty clever)
* bug: when AI plays higher than lead domino and lead is double
* flow: when no matches to lead - play lowest domino
