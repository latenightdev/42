TODO:
- board and grave to components
- game over results instead of trick results (when any player's hand.length === 0)

- domino.selected color = blue?
- log: scroll to bottom automatically?
- loading: change color to blue?
- random: investigate random deal method make better

- flow: followAI: if not my partner don't play cash
  - simple.  add a removeCounts that takes an array and returns array WITHOUT counts.
  - can do an extra check after creating new array and if it ended up empty go back!
- flow: when lead is not a trump and no matches to lead - AI can trump to take trick

- favicon

- these 2 below may be related!
- domino.getValue/getName should depend on the LEAD value not necessarily the trump value
- bug: domino name incorrect (ex: 2-3 follows a 2-2 and is called 3-2 in log)

- EPIC: score: ALL or similar scoring tracked from game to game

- consider: logging service


DONE:
* EPIC: flow (lead): ability for player to analyze hand and declare bid/trump
