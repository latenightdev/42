TODO:
- board and grave to components
- game over results instead of trick results (when any player's hand.length === 0)

- domino.selected color = blue?
- log: scroll to bottom automatically?
- loading: change color to blue?
- random: investigate random deal method make better

- flow: followAI: if not my partner don't play cash
  - simple.  add a removeCounts that takes an array and returns array WITHOUT counts.
  - can do an extra check after creating new array and if it ended up empty go back!
- flow: when lead is not a trump and no matches to lead - AI can trump to take trick

- favicon

- these 2 below may be related!
- domino.getValue/getName should depend on the LEAD value not necessarily the trump value
- bug: domino name incorrect (ex: 2-3 follows a 2-2 and is called 3-2 in log)

- EPIC: flow (lead): ability for player to analyze hand and declare bid/trump
- EPIC: score: ALL or similar scoring tracked from game to game

- consider: logging service


DONE:
* bug: createPopper drop down menu
* end of trick: maybe just a Next button instead of modal.
* dropdown menu toggle for: show log, show debug icons, show dominoes, show grave trick details, etc
* flow (follow): partners should play count when they have no matches (before playing lowest)
* fun! refactor: DRY-out stuff like resetting for a new hand to utility methods
* consider: state service where game/player services can share state better!  dumbass!
* consider blank screen / background image before starting a game
* prompt to enter Player 1 name (during bid for now)
* refactor: move applicable methods from game.service to domino.service and player.service
* graveyard - add stats next to each trick
* fix debug info icons on board, grave, anywhere else!
* clear log on new game
  * other stuff needs to be reset too - bid, grave on debug game, etc
* AI follow with lowest trump when they cannot win trick otherwise highest!
* audit which things should happen before/after trick modal
* cleanup state
  * trump, bid amount to player's sub-heading
  * turn, leadValue, activePlayer to Board sub-heading
* end trick pops a modal with trick results and click button to start next trick
* setup navigation bar
* deliberation timeout to variable
* log should be set height and scroll
* add text activity log that shows every move
* add score total next to each player
* fix player button designn
* fix bid modal design
* EPIC: test bed needed (wow you pretty clever)
* bug: when AI plays higher than lead domino and lead is double
* flow: when no matches to lead - play lowest domino
